# C Programming: A Modern Approach (Solutions & Study)

This repository serves as a sandbox for reviewing C, following the curriculum of **"C Programming: A Modern Approach" (2nd Edition) by K.N. King**.

The goal of this project is to refresh core systems programming concepts, enforce strict coding standards, and explore low-level memory management techniques.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized by chapter to track progression through language features:

* `exercise/`: Solutions to specific book exercises (Chapter 01 - Chapter 27).
* `example/`: Solutions to specific book examples (Chapter 01 - Chapter 27).

<!--## 🛠 Key Concepts Implemented

Throughout these exercises, the following concepts are explored and implemented:

* **Memory Management:** Manual allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`) and strict leak prevention.
* **Pointers & Arrays:** Pointer arithmetic, multi-dimensional arrays, and function pointers.
* **Data Structures:** Implementation of linked lists, trees, and custom structs.
* **The Preprocessor:** Macro definitions, conditional compilation, and header guards.
* **File I/O:** Stream processing and binary file manipulation.
* **Build Systems:** Usage of `Makefiles` for automated compilation. -->

## 🚀 How to Build

All code is written to be compliant with the C99 standard.

**Prerequisites:**
* GCC or Clang compiler
* Make
